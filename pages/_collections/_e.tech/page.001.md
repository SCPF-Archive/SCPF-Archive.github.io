#### Why internet is good for us?
The internet is an amazing tool that helps us in many ways. It gives us access to a lot of information, like books, articles, and videos, which we can use for learning and exploring new things. We can learn about different subjects, discover new hobbies, and even find answers to our questions. It's like having a big library right at our fingertips!

Additionally, the internet allows us to connect with people from all over the world. We can make new friends, share experiences, and learn about different cultures. We can talk to family members who are far away or play games with friends who live in a different city. The internet helps us stay connected and learn from each other, making the world feel like a smaller and more interesting place!
