Citra is a Nintendo 3DS emulator for Android that's capable of running tons of games from this console's catalog at full speed. This is the developer's first official public version after several forks or versions modified by third parties have popped up. It compiles some of the features implemented by the other versions and unifies them in a common project that, after several years of upgrades, has finally reached its prime.
