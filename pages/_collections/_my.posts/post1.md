### Introduction
We watch more than 1 billion hours of YouTube videos every single day. That's more videos watched daily than on Facebook and Netflix combined. As of user number, YouTube has more than 2.6 billion logged-in monthly users, and that's second only to Facebook which has more than 2.9 billion.

It is very possible that you are already aware of all that — after all, it is common knowledge that YouTube is extremely popular. And given that you found this article, you probably spend some time on YouTube every day yourself, contributing to the stats. And, of course, it can be safely assumed that you are not too happy that a noticeable portion of that time has to be spent on viewing ads, when you're just waiting for the skip button instead of watching the actual videos. Wouldn't it be great if you could just watch YouTube uninterrupted, without unskippable ads?

So let's have a glance at how to block ads on YouTube, and reasons to why your adblock is not working on YouTube as you want it to.

### Types of YouTube ads

| --- | --- |
| Display ads | Shows up next to the video (Desktop and laptop PCs only). |
| Overlay ads | Appears across the bottom 20% of the video window (Desktop and laptop PCs only). Can be dismissed by pressing the "x" mark. |
| Skippable video ads | The most common ad format. Users can skip the ad after viewing it for 5 seconds. It can be inserted before, during, or after the video. |
| Non-skippable video ads and long, non-skippable video ads | Unskippable 15+ second ad. It can be inserted before, during, or after the video. |
| Midroll ads | Appear on videos over 10 minutes: ads are spaced within the video, like TV commercials. User must watch the ad before continuing through the video. |
| Bumper ads | A lightweight, non-skippable video ad up to 6 seconds long. User must watch the entire ad before the video can be viewed. |
| Content-embedded ads | Ads that are in the YouTube video itself, absolutely unblockable but can be skipped manually |
