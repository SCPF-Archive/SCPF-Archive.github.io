<th>Who?</th>
<td>I&#39;m <code>Angie Dela Mandevilla</code>, I&#39;m a househooman that finds myself staying indoors more than spending the time outdoors with so-called friends. I picked the username <code>SCP-017</code> because like that entity, I&#39;m also contained or isolated, but by my own will, lmao, and I&#39;m also covered with shadows, just an imaginary ones, I guess?</td>

<tr>
<th>What?</th>
<td>This is a website or GitHub pages where you can find some useful posts, ReVanced apps, cool apps here on GitHub, any many more to come soon, I guess?</td>

<tr>
<th>Why?</th>
<td>This is just a hobby of mine, when I&#39;m bored or I&#39;m doing nothing, I do some improvements or updates on my projects. I want to help or give knowledge to others even though it&#39;s just a small thing for them or not because I believe that our purpose in this life is to pass the knowledge that we know to others so it can be preserved and innovated.</td>
